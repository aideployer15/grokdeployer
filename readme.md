# Grok Deployer

Download the Python file and change its extension to “.txt, since Grok will throw an error if you upload a .py file or a .json file for the keypair.

Create an additional file named “keypair.txt”. The content should look something like this:



```python
keypair="<your_base58_keypair>"
```
